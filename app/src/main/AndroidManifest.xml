### Explanation of Configuration

1. **Application Component Registration**:
   - **MainActivity**: This is the primary interface that users interact with. It is designated as the launcher activity, allowing for a straightforward entry point upon app launch.
   - **AutomationService**: A dedicated service running in the background ensures continuous operations for filtering users without user intervention, which aligns with best practices for running long operations in Android.

2. **Permission Management**:
   - Permissions for **INTERNET** and **READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE**/**WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE** are explicitly declared to grant the necessary capabilities for data handling and network operations. This approach adheres to Android's security model by requiring users' consent for sensitive operations.

3. **Technical Best Practices**:
   - The use of distinct components (activities and services) enhances modularity, which is crucial for maintainability and scalability.
   - Ensuring that **AutomationService** is not exported enhances the app's security, allowing for only internal interaction. This prevents unauthorized access from other applications, protecting user data and the integrity of the tool.

This configuration is designed to support the functionalities of the "fb user filtering tool" while adhering to best practices in Android development.
