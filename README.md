## Project Overview

MadHub's powerful **Facebook User Collection** feature is designed to streamline the process of identifying and interacting with specific users on Facebook. This feature allows you to collect Facebook users efficiently based on various filtering criteria, making it an essential tool for marketers and business owners looking to enhance their customer engagement.

### Feature Capabilities

The **Facebook User Collection** feature offers robust capabilities for gathering user data. You can utilize two distinct collection modes: **Profile Mode** and **Blogger Mode**. 

1. **Profile Mode**: This mode allows you to filter and interact with specified users directly. You can send friend requests, private messages, and conduct other batch operations, all tailored to your unique target audience.
   
2. **Blogger Mode**: This mode enables you to filter potential clients from the followers or following lists of targeted bloggers. By leveraging AI avatar recognition and multi-dimensional filtering criteria, you can efficiently identify users who align with your marketing goals.

### How to Use the Feature

Using the **Facebook User Collection** feature in MadHub is straightforward. Follow these steps:

1. **Access the User Collection Tool**: Launch MadHub and navigate to the Facebook User Collection feature.
  
2. **Select Collection Mode**: Choose between **Profile Mode** or **Blogger Mode** based on your needs.

3. **Set Filtering Criteria**: Configure the filtering options to narrow down your user search. You can set parameters such as:
   - **AI Avatar Recognition**: Filter users based on their profile pictures.
   - **Country Filtering**: Target specific geographic regions.
   - **Friend Count Filtering**: Focus on users with a certain number of friends.
   - **Mutual Friend Filtering**: Identify users connected through mutual friends.
   - **Bio Link Filtering**: Filter users based on the information in their bios.

4. **Perform Batch Operations**: Once you have configured your filters, use the tool to perform actions like sending friend requests or private messages in bulk.

### Configuration Examples

To configure the **Facebook User Collection** feature effectively, consider the following examples tailored for specific goals:

- **Profile Mode Configuration**:
   - Set interaction probability for sending requests: `interaction_probability = 80%` (high probability to increase success rates).
   - Select friend count filter: `friend_count_min = 50` (focusing on users with at least 50 friends).

- **Blogger Mode Configuration**:
   - Activate AI Avatar Recognition: `enable_AI_recognition = true` (to ensure targeted user visuals).
